## Features
- Personalized Learning Paths: Customized reading plans and activities tailored to each user's likes and how well they're doing to help them learn better.
- Adaptive Learning: Changes the difficulty of reading materials as users get better, so they're always challenged just enough to keep learning.
- Text Summarization: Makes long passages shorter, so users can understand the main ideas faster and easier.
- Feedback and Assessment: Gives users instant feedback on how fast they read, how well they understand, and tips to get better.
- Eye Movement Tracking: Watches how users' eyes move when they read to find out where they can improve and gives them exercises to help.
- Content Recommendation: This shows users reading materials they'll like based on what they've read before and what they're interested in.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Helps make reading materials easier to understand by breaking down hard sentences and words and explaining them.
- Interactive Exercises: Fun and personalized activities that feel like real reading situations to help users get better and remember what they've learned.
- Progress Tracking and Visualization: Keeps track of how users are doing over time and shows them graphs and charts to see how they're getting better, so they stay motivated to keep going.
